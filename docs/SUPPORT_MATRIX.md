# Format Support Matrix

SeaCad through M4.3a can open an immutable raw ASCII framing document, enforce
or recover its EOF envelope, attach a one-pass SHA-256 source identity,
discover an exact HEADER `$ACADVER`, account every parsed group inside or
outside non-overlapping sections, index every numeric group code 0, discover
the exact `$DWGCODEPAGE` declaration, derive a fail-closed text-storage policy,
and write a separately verified byte-identical copy. The CLI exposes `inspect`
and `verify` with English/Vietnamese human output, JSON v1, stable exits, and
path redaction. These M4 reports remain core APIs and are not exposed in CLI
JSON v1 yet.

| Format | Version | Read | Preserve | Semantic | Edit/Write |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| DXF ASCII | AC1009-AC1032 | Raw framing + dialect/structure/text-storage policy | Verified Verbatim only | No decoded strings or record payloads | Not implemented |
| DXF Binary | AC1009-AC1032 | Not implemented | Not implemented | Not implemented | Not implemented |
| DWG | Any | Out of scope | Out of scope | Out of scope | Out of scope |
| DGN V7/V8 | Any | Out of scope | Out of scope | Out of scope | Out of scope |

A cell changes only after its milestone closes with deterministic evidence.
"Envelope structure" recognizes exact section boundaries and record starts
without interpreting section payloads. Unknown section names remain exact
source-backed bytes. "Text-storage policy" means UTF-8 by documented modern
version or a provenance-backed legacy declaration; it does not yet decode any
string. "Verified Verbatim" only creates a new byte-identical file and is not
an edit or canonical writer.
